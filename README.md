Welcome to my first attempt at making a full fledged (sort of) game!

Instructions to run
1. Create a virtual engironment at the top level of your project directory
    ```
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
2. Activate the virtual environment
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. You should see a venv file at the root of this project
4. run the install command
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Run the game!
    ```
    python3 -m pygame
    ```
